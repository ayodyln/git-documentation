## What is Git?

Git is a project management tool for the development of applications. The tool gained prominence in the industry for being an open-source version control system. With the capabilities to be distributed, meaning that this is a version control system that puts a copy of the repository (package of code) on a developer's computer. Enabling them to interact with that local copy by _branching_, _merging_, and _committing_ changes. Also giving a developer the ability to navigate between branches, commit history, and much more all in something called a _repository_. Which is essentially a Git initialized project that lets you have version control capabilities.

## Why use Git? What problem does it solve?

When working with projects in general, it would be wise to work on that project and produce multiple versions of that. So that the project iterates and grows to a final version (e.g., rough drafting up to a final version). Using Git can help establish a workflow that ensures the development of a project, with multiple iterations. The ability to travel back in _time_ of a git repository history is possible too since each commit is tracked in a timeline. It is also possible to traverse branches too, which can be different build versions of an application--production or development for example.

Having the ability to traverse a figurative tree, in other words, a _file tree structure_. Lets developers or teams manage each step of a project and go back to a commit in the repositories history. One major thing that Git helps solve is the ability to collaborate with others on a project. Working on a selected file could lead to conflicts of some kind. For example, for a project, there is a location designated for the files, and being able to work on the same file as another is not recommended or is impossible. You would have to coordinate with what files you would be working on and also figure out a way to have access to the source of the project. To solve this Git, lets developers install copies of the repository on their machine and then contribute to the projects through their commits.

## What is the difference between Git and Github?

Multiple services use the name **Git** within their branding. Such as `Github`, `GitLab`, and `GitBucket`. This is because Git is an open-source system that services have created hosting. The version control system itself could run independently of these services, although most are free to use. It's possible to house a repository locally on one machine, or a part of a local network/server. However, hosting a repository remotely is easy and it safeguards it from being accidentally deleted, meaning there is a backup in a safe location.

Github does not own the Git DVCS, since that is open source. What they do is build upon that service and make it visual and easy to use. When a repository is set up on GitHub, that is known as a _remote_. Meaning it is not locally present on the machine, but is remotely accessible. Typically, git remotes have been configured to be a URL. This is where GitHub comes to play, by integrating their service with Git. Any code commits on a working project, could be _pushed_ to the remote, updating the source of truth for an application.
